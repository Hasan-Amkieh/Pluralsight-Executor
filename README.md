# Pluralsight-Executor
Pluralsight Executor is designed to ease the process of opening "Pluralsight Offline Player" program and to disconnect the PC from the internet before opening it. After that, if pluralsight gets closed, the network adapter that got disabled will be enabled again automatically. The main purpose is to prevent pluralsight from getting any access to the internet, which will keep all the downloaded courses available for you (without the necessity to subscribe every month), unless you forgot so and opened it with the internet connected.

The only problem that you could face is getting the admin privileges request, once before opening pluralsight and once after closing pluralsight. A simple solution could be by opening the application as an admin, which will save you a little bit of time and effort.

# Pluralsight-Executor
Pluralsight Executor is a program that is designed to ease the process of opening "Pluralsight Offline Player" program and to disconnect the PC from the internet before opening it. Then, if pluralsight gets closed, the network adapter that got disabled will be enabled again automatically.
